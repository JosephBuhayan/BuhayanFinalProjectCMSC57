            <h2>II. Algebraic Structures</h2>
            <p class="topic-introduction">
                Algebraic structures are fundamental in mathematics. They consist of a set combined with one or more binary operations defined on that set, all of which must satisfy a specific list of axioms (rules or properties). Studying these structures allows us to understand the common properties of diverse mathematical systems in an abstract way.

                <strong>Real-life context:</strong> The familiar system of integers with the operations of addition and multiplication is a rich algebraic structure. Understanding these structures helps in fields like computer science (for data structures and algorithms), cryptography (for secure communication), and coding theory (for error correction).

                <p>
                    <strong>Abstracting Common Properties: </strong> They provide a powerful way to study systems that share fundamental structural properties, regardless of what the elements actually "are." <br>
                    <strong>Cryptography: </strong> Many modern cryptographic systems (like RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography) are built upon the properties of specific groups. The difficulty of certain problems within these groups (e.g., the discrete logarithm problem) forms the basis of their security. <br>
                    <strong>Coding Theory: </strong> Error-correcting codes often utilize group structures to detect and correct errors in transmitted data. <br>
                    <strong>Graph Theory: </strong> Automorphism groups of graphs describe their symmetries. <br>
